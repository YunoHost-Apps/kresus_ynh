Please remember the default behavior of YunoHost when installing a new app is: everyone has access to the app.
This may be an issue for Kresus as it is a personal tool. Please remember to edit access rights in the YunoHost web administration panel or using command line interface.

Note about config.ini: this package will regenerate the config file on upgrade.
If you changed it manually and upgraded Kresus, you'll find a backup in __INSTALL_DIR__.
