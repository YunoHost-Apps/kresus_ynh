⚠️ Every YunoHost account will have access to this app when "all_users" is selected in the install questions. This may be an issue for Kresus as it is a personal tool. Please remember to edit the access rights in the YunoHost web administration panel or using command line interface.

The configuration file is stored in ` __INSTALL_DIR__/config.ini` and is regenerated on upgrade.
